# datasette-kindle-highlights - freedom of highlights

datasette-kindle-highlights imports Kindle highlights and notes from [Bookcision](https://readwise.io/bookcision) into a SQLite database. This project also leverages Simon Wilson's [datasette](https://github.com/simonw/datasette) project to export the resulting database as a website.
